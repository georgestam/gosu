Welcome to Gosu!
================

Gosu's main website is [libgosu.org](https://www.libgosu.org/).
The source code, wiki, issue tracker and change log are all hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/gosu/gosu)

The best entry point into Gosu's documentation is the [wiki home page](https://github.com/gosu/gosu/wiki).
Try doing the tutorial there if you don't know how to get started,
or look at one of the games in the [Gosu Showcase](https://www.libgosu.org/cgi-bin/mwf/board_show.pl?bid=2) board.
